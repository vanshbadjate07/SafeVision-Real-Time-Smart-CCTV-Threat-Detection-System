# PROPOSED SOLUTION

**SafeVision** is an intelligent, real-time CCTV monitoring system that actively detects threats and triggers immediate alerts. Instead of only recording footage, the system continuously analyses live video to identify suspicious activities such as **confirmed unauthorised entry** and **camera tampering**, while robustly filtering out false alarms.

The system allows users to define custom monitoring zones and enable an ‘Away Mode’ when they are not at home. **To specifically address night-time risks, SafeVision incorporates an automatic 'Night Mode' that proactively arms surveillance during sleeping hours (e.g., 12 AM - 5 AM) without requiring user intervention.** To ensure reliability, the system utilizes a **'Smart Verification' protocol that requires a 2-second continuous detection window** before confirming a threat, effectively eliminating false positives.

If suspicious activity is detected, SafeVision instantly notifies the owner through a web interface. If the owner does not respond within a fixed time window, the system automatically escalates the alert by sending captured evidence and location details to emergency contacts or police authorities. This ensures safety even when the user is unavailable, asleep, or unable to respond.
